Hey there! I am a software engineer currently working for New Pig in Pittsburgh, PA. Previously I've worked for a small Pittsburgh startup, as well as GE Aviation. In addition to New Pig I am currently an adjunct professor of computer science at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania.

I grew up in the small town of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania for the first 18 years of my life before attending Saint Francis University for my undergraduate degree in computer science. I later completed my graduate studies at Georgia Tech, earning an MS in computer science. I have spent stints in both Pittsburgh, PA as well as Cincinnati, OH. When I'm not writing code I like to immerse myself in sports, video games, books, woodworking, and the occasional campaign of Dungeons and Dragons. I'm a devoted fan of the Cincinnati Bengals as well as FC Cincinnati.

My current interests are working with the web and modern web technologies. I try to incorporate these practical approaches and relevant industry skills in my college courses along with necessary time-tested theory to help create well-rounded software engineers for the years to come.
