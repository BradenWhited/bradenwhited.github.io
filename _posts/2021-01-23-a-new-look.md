### Hello, World!

It recently came to my attention that my previous personal website/portfolio had gone for **quite** some time without a rebrand (or even frequent updates). In the time since I've grown and changed in a person, both in values, in hobbies, and in motivation. As such, I felt like it was time for a redo of bradenwhited.com into what you see now.

I hope to take advantage of this new look by expanding my page beyond solely my technical pedigree as an engineer and to include some of the other facets of my life. I don't plan on getting too personal, but I'm certainly interested in blogging about tech, woodworking, books, and video games. I've also become quite the avid tabletop game enthusiast during the COVID-19 pandemic, so I might bring that up as well. 

That's all for now. See you soon.
